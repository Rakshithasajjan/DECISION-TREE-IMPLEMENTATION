#This Python code demonstrates how to build and evaluate a **Decision Tree Classifier** using the **Iris dataset**, a classic dataset in machine learning. It starts by importing essential libraries and loading the dataset, which contains flower measurements (like petal and sepal sizes) for three iris species. The data is then split into training and testing sets using an 80-20 ratio. A Decision Tree model with a maximum depth of 3 is trained on the training data and used to predict the flower species in the test set. The model's performance is evaluated using **accuracy** and a **classification report**, which details precision, recall, and F1-score for each class. Finally, the structure of the trained decision tree is visually displayed using a plot, helping to understand the decision-making process of the model.
